How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By looking at what changed from the working code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So that you don't have to be making changes to restore an old version, it's simply there.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro is that commits will make more sense, but you might forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the different systems treat different kinds of files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log provides list of commits, git diff provides difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
